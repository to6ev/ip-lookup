IP lookup with PHP and using free API

We will use free API from: www.freegeoip.net (it was without Access Key) and www.ipinfo.io (without Access Key, no signup is required actually)

but www.freegeoip.net = www.ipstack.com now, and the new API is with free Access Key ... You must sign up and to get your own key.
